    <h3>Her Childhood</h3>
    
    <p> Susan B. Anthony was born on February 15, 1820 in Adams, Massachusetts. Her full name was Susan Brownell Anthony. Her father, Daniel Anthony, was a farmer and later je was a cotton mill owner and manager and was raised as a Quaker. Her mother, Lucy, came from a family that fought in the American Revolution and served in the Massachusetts state government. She was the second oldest of 7 children. One of her siblings was stillborn and another died at age two.
    <p> In 1826, the Anthony family moved to Battenville, New York. Around this time, Anthony was sent to study at a Quaker school near Philadelphia. After her father's business failed in the late 1830s, Anthony returned home to help her family make ends meet. She found work as a teacher. The Anthonys moved to a farm in the Rochester, New York area, in the mid-1840s.
    
    <p>In the 1840s, the Anthony family became involved in the fight to end slavery, also known as the abolitionist movement. The Anthonys' Rochester farm served as a meeting place for such famed abolitionists as Frederick Douglass. Around this time, Susan became the head of the girls' department at Canajoharie Academy — a post she held for two years.
