    <h3>Her Childhood</h3>
    
    <p> Susan B. Anthony was born on February 15, 1820 in Adams, Massachusetts. Her full name was Susan Brownell Anthony. Her father, Daniel Anthony, was a farmer and later he was a cotton mill owner and manager and was raised as a Quaker. Her mother, Lucy, came from a family that fought in the American Revolution and served in the Massachusetts state government. She was the second oldest of 7 children. One of her siblings was stillborn and another died at age two.
    <p> In 1826, the Anthony family moved to Battenville, New York. Around this time, Susan was sent to study at a Quaker school near Philadelphia. After her father's business failed in the late 1830s, Susan B. Anthony returned home to help her family make ends meet. She found work as a teacher. The Anthonys moved to a farm in the Rochester, New York area, in the mid-1840s.
    
    <p>In the 1840s, the Anthony family became involved in the fight to end slavery, also known as the abolitionist movement. The Anthonys' Rochester farm served as a meeting place for such famed abolitionists as Frederick Douglass. Around this time, Susan became the head of the girls' department at Canajoharie Academy — a post she held for two years.

    <h3>Her Education</h3>
        <p>Susan B. Anthony learned how to read and write at the age of three. After her family had moved from Massachusetts to Battensville, New York, she attended a district school, then a school set up by her father, and finally a boarding school near Philadelphia. In 1839 she took a position in a Quaker seminary in New Rochelle, New York. From 1846 to 1849 she taught at a female academy in upstate New York.
        <p> At some time when Susan was in public school her teacher refused to teach her long division because she was not a boy. She then left the school.

    <h3>What She Did After That</h3>
    
    <p>Susan was an American writer, lecturer and abolitionist who was a leading figure in the women's voting rights movement. Susan B. Susan B Anthony went on to work as a teacher. After many years of teaching, Susan returned to her family who had moved to New York State.
    <p>The rebuff of Susan’s attempt to speak at a temperance meeting in Albany in 1852 prompted her to organize the Woman’s New York State Temperance Society, of which Elizabeth Cady Stanton became president, and pushed Susan B. Anthony farther in the direction of women’s rights advocacy. In a short time she became known as one of the cause’s most zealous, serious advocates, a dogged and tireless worker whose personality contrasted sharply with that of her friend and coworker Elizabeth. She was also a prime target of public and newspaper abuse. While campaigning for a liberalization of New York’s laws regarding married women’s property rights, an end attained in 1860, Susan served from 1856 as chief New York agent of Garrison’s American Anti-Slavery Society. 
    <p>During the early phase of the Civil War she helped organize the Women’s National Loyal League, which urged the case for emancipation. After the war she campaigned unsuccessfully to have the language of the Fourteenth Amendment altered to allow for woman as well as African American suffrage, and in 1866 she became corresponding secretary of the newly formed American Equal Rights Association. Her exhausting speaking and organizing tour of Kansas in 1867 failed to win passage of a state enfranchisement law.
    <p>After she gave that speech, in 1868 Susan and Elizabeth co-founded the American Equal Rights Association. In 1868 they became editors of the Association’s newspaper, The Revolution, which helped to spread the ideas of equality and rights for women. Susan B. Anthony began to lecture to raise money for publishing the newspaper and to support the suffrage movement. She became famous throughout the county. Many people admired her, yet others hated her ideas.</p>

    <h3>The Speech She Gave</h3>
    
    <p> She belived that women should be able to vote. So, in 1872, Susan was arrested for voting. She was tried and fined $100 for her crime. This made many people angry and brought national attention to the suffrage movement. In 1876, she led a protest at the 1876 Centennial of our nation’s independence. She gave a speech—“Declaration of Rights”— It goes like this.</p>
    <div id="speech">
    <p>"Friends and fellow citizens: I stand before you tonight under indictment for the alleged crime of having voted at the last presidential election, without having a lawful right to vote. It shall be my work this evening to prove to you that in thus voting, I not only committed no crime, but, instead, simply exercised my citizen's rights, guaranteed to me and all United States citizens by the National Constitution, beyond the power of any state to deny.</p>

<p>The preamble of the Federal Constitution says:

<p>"We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."

<p>It was we, the people; not we, the white male citizens; nor yet we, the male citizens; but we, the whole people, who formed the Union. And we formed it, not to give the blessings of liberty, but to secure them; not to the half of ourselves and the half of our posterity, but to the whole people - women as well as men. And it is a downright mockery to talk to women of their enjoyment of the blessings of liberty while they are denied the use of the only means of securing them provided by this democratic-republican government - the ballot.

<p>For any state to make sex a qualification that must ever result in the disfranchisement of one entire half of the people, is to pass a bill of attainder, or, an ex post facto law, and is therefore a violation of the supreme law of the land. By it the blessings of liberty are forever withheld from women and their female posterity.

<p>To them this government has no just powers derived from the consent of the governed. To them this government is not a democracy. It is not a republic. It is an odious aristocracy; a hateful oligarchy of sex; the most hateful aristocracy ever established on the face of the globe; an oligarchy of wealth, where the rich govern the poor. An oligarchy of learning, where the educated govern the ignorant, or even an oligarchy of race, where the Saxon rules the African, might be endured; but this oligarchy of sex, which makes father, brothers, husband, sons, the oligarchs over the mother and sisters, the wife and daughters, of every household - which ordains all men sovereigns, all women subjects, carries dissension, discord, and rebellion into every home of the nation.

<p>Webster, Worcester, and Bouvier all define a citizen to be a person in the United States, entitled to vote and hold office.

<p>The only question left to be settled now is: Are women persons? And I hardly believe any of our opponents will have the hardihood to say they are not. Being persons, then, women are citizens; and no state has a right to make any law, or to enforce any old law, that shall abridge their privileges or immunities. Hence, every discrimination against women in the constitutions and laws of the several states is today null and void, precisely as is every one against Negroes."

    <h3>After That</h3>
    
    <p>When Congress passed the 14th and 15th amendments which give voting rights to African American men, Susan and Elizabeth were angry and opposed the legislation because it did not include the right to vote for women. Their belief led them to split from other suffragists. They thought the amendments should also have given women the right to vote. They formed the National Woman Suffrage Association, to push for a constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote.</p>
    
    <p>Susan B. Anthony spent her life working for women’s rights. In 1888, she helped to merge the two largest suffrage associations into one, the National American Women’s Suffrage Association. She led the group until 1900. She traveled around the country giving speeches, gathering thousands of signatures on petitions, and lobbying Congress every year for women.</p> 
    <p>Susan died on March 13, 1906 of pneumonia in Rochester, New York. 14 years before women were given the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920.</p>

        <h3>5 Quotes Said By Susan B. Anthony</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>"Here, in the first paragraph of the Declaration, is the assertion of the natural right of all to the ballot; for how can 'the consent of the governed' be given, if the right to vote be denied?"
            <li>"You would better educate ten women into the practice of liberal principles than to organize a thousand on a platform of intolerance and bigotry.”
            <li>“It was we, the people, not we, the white male citizens, nor yet we, the male citizens; but we, the whole people, who formed this Union.”
            <li>“To think I have had more than 60 years of hard struggle for a little liberty, and then to die without it seems so cruel.”
            <li>“Oh, if I could but live another century and see the fruition of all the work for women! There is so much yet to be done.”
